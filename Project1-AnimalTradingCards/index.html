            <p class="interesting">Aye-aye is often viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest
                finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts
                the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it.</p>
